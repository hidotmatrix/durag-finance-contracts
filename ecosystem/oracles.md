# Oracles

## Introduction

Oracle is external smart-contract used to provide offchain data to onchain applications. Below you can find Nervos ecosystem oracle partners that have already deployed their contracts along with documentation.

Below you can find addresses of oracles for the testnet version v1.0. The oracles below haven't been deployed yet to testnet v1.1. We will update the addresses below as soon as our partners deploy their oracles to new testnet.
